*This x86-to-C interface programming project serves to perform a dot product between vector A and vector B and place the result in sdot, the dot product of vectors A and B.*

<ins>**Input:**</ins> Scalar variable n (integer) contains the length of the vector;  Vectors A and B are both double-precision float. Scalar sdot is a double-precision float.

<ins>**Output:**</ins> Store the result in memory location sdot.  Display the result for all versions of the kernel.

## Comparative Execution Time

The average execution time of the <ins>C kernel</ins> given the following input sizes are as follows:

<ins>**2<sup>20</sup>**</ins>

<ins>**2<sup>24</sup>**</ins>

<ins>**2<sup>30</sup>**</ins>
